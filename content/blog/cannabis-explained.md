So, we get it. Sometimes words, especially big words, are difficult to remember and fully understand. ‘Cannabis’ isn’t particularly difficult to read or understand on the surface, and we bet you’ve heard it thrown around more and more as the world continues to change. However, it is quite a BIG word in other ways,  as it’s most often associated with scary things like Schedule I drugs, illegal activity, narcotics, felony, and prison.

Getting nervous yet?… Fear not! We are here to help clarify some things.

Cannabis is an ancient plant. For perspective, science has determined that humans came into contact with it about 12,000 years ago, whereas the written word has only been around for about 5,500 years. Since it’s discovery, cultures of people all over the world have been using cannabis for it’s various beneficial properties, and it wasn’t until the early 1900s, when it started to become associated with other narcotics, that it was labeled as a Schedule I substance in the United States.

These days, cannabis is often referred to in two ways—hemp and marijuana—and until recently, both were stuck with the ‘majorly illegal drug’ label. (Click here to learn more about the 2018 Farm Bill, which makes the distinction between the two plant-cousins official.)

Hemp refers to the cannabis sativa (suh-TEE-vuh) plant that has been cultivated for industrial use throughout the ages. Its stalks, roots, leaves, flowers and seeds can all be used to make a BUNCH of different things. It’s also a highly sustainable crop, which means it’s not only good for us, but it’s good for Mother Nature… Bonus! Another key characteristic of hemp—it has many of the same beneficial properties of marijuana as a therapy or treatment but without the high! Another huge bonus! We dive into that topic a little deeper here.

The term marijuana is a little more problematic. First of all, we at Delta Labs do not desire to use the actual term marijuana to refer to cannabis at all, as we believe it implies negative racial bias, particularly against Mexican and Central American culture. However, now that we know that the word cannabis includes more than just the stuff that sends you into ‘reefer madness’, we’re at a loss for another mainstream term to use that doesn’t make us sound like we’re trying to rip off Cheech & Chong. In addition to the actual term being problematic, marijuana is still considered a Schedule I substance by the United States government, which means that it’s currently considered to have zero medical or therapeutic value. Yes, it’s allowed in specific states that have decided to legalize it under either recreational or medical circumstances, but nationwide, it’s a no-go if you want to keep your record clean. For consumers, the main difference between marijuana and hemp in terms of wellness is that one gets you high and one doesn’t. One is now legal in all 50 states while the other can get you in trouble with the Feds. And it’s all because of the presence of one little compound: THC.

THC, or tetrahydracannabinol, is one of around 100 compounds in cannabis flower resin that interact with the body’s nervous system. These compounds are called cannabinoids. You can pronounce that word in one of two ways: kuh-NAB-in-oids or CAN-uh-bin-oids (...po-tay-to, po-tah-to, to-may-to, to-mah-to, use the one you like the best, as we do not discriminate!), and we are working on a digestible write-up that will take you further down the path of understanding what cannabinoids are, how they work in the body, and why we think they’re amazing.

For now, all you need to remember is that THC is the one that causes the “high” associated with cannabis. In order for cannabis to qualify as hemp, the plant must be tested and shown to contain 0.3% or less of THC. This is a very small amount. Let’s say you you have ten donuts in front of you, but you can only eat 0.3% of them. That means you would need to cut one of those donuts evenly into one hundred slivers, and then only eat three of those tiny shreds!

But let’s go back—remember how we mentioned that THC is only one of about a hundred cannabinoids in cannabis? Well, there’s another one that is making major waves in the health and wellness community that may be the reason you’re here anyway: cannabidiol (‘can-uh-bih-DYE-ol), a.k.a. CBD. And while hemp has a very, very low THC content, it typically contains ample amounts of CBD and other cannabinoids, making it extremely useful in providing the benefits of cannabis without the risk of any “drugged” state or sensation. It also presents the very low, almost negligible probability of suggesting illegal drug use on a drug test.

Due to recent discoveries and research regarding cannabis and it’s therapeutic properties, cannabinoids like CBD and THC have been studied as potential forms of therapy or treatment for many physical and psychological issues including but not limited to inflammation and pain, seizures, anxiety, depression, nausea, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, dimensia and sleep disorders. Our post on the way our body uses these compounds explains more specifics on benefits if you’d like to learn more.

Looking for the TL;DR? Here it is—Cannabis is an ancient plant that’s not just for “stoners”. Both of its variants – hemp and marijuana – can help people and animals (yes, your pets are not excluded!) to live a calmer, more stress-free life, naturally. Thanks to the continuing study of hemp and CBD, we are learning more and more about how cannabinoids can facilitate balance and relief without the high or fear of legal trouble, and it’s all very exciting!

We hope this post along with the rest of our catalog of articles can help you on your journey as you discover the ways this powerful, all-natural wellness option can change the way we take care of ourselves.

Be Well and Happy Learning!
