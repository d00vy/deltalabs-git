Jack: “Hey Jill! Have you tried CBD yet?”

Jill: “No, but I’ve heard people talk about it! What is CBD, Jack?”

Jack: “Uhhhh… here, read this!”

A lot of hype has been drummed up online and in the media about CBD and we know you’ve got questions! Until a few years ago, not much was seen or heard about it by the average American. But once the distinction was officially made between hemp and marijuana, “CBD” started popping up everywhere! Radio ads, billboards and giant banners in front of retail stores advertising CBD products were the first we noticed. And once we started seeing memes about it online, we confirmed that there was real hubbub about this stuff. A compound that was obscure in the not-so-distant past has now become a term on everyone’s lips.

One of the primary benefits CBD has been studied for is its ability to effectively treat epilepsy and seizures, and there are even prescription CBD medications on the market today that serve that purpose. (If you have time, check out Charlotte Figi’s story.) However, it is also being studied for its potential to be a useful, therapeutic compound for people who suffer from a wide variety of physical and psychological issues. As a non-addictive substance, it is also being looked at as a potential treatment for drug addiction and abuse.

Question: What exactly is CBD?
Let’s start at the beginning. CBD stands for Cannabidiol (‘kan-uh-bih-DYE-ol), which is one of about a hundred compounds in the cannabis plant called cannabinoids. Cannabinoids work with your nervous system to achieve balance, or homeostatsis, in the body when responding to stress. This stress can be an internal one, like a chronic disorder or disease, or it can be an external one, like a physical injury or mental/emotional stress trigger. Hemp, a variant of cannabis, has a particularly high CBD content.

Okay, what’s so special about this one compound?
CBD has specifically been studied and marketed recently due to claims that it provides many of the benefits of cannabis plant without any “high” as a result. It is also legal to have and use in the United States when sourced from hemp. To learn more about the plant and its distinctions, click here.

So what’s in it for me? Or you? Or anyone else? Why is CBD such a hot topic?
Well, the “proof” at this point is not technically proof. Reports of general benefits are mostly anecdotal—like I said, CBD is being studied. But many people claim to have had success in managing pain, relieving symptoms of various illnesses, and achieving an overall sense of balance, relief and calm when using CBD. It’s also important to note that CBD is attractive because it is a natural, plant-derived compound, not a lab-generated pharmaceutical drug. Who doesn’t want that? And there you have the reason for all the buzz.

Okay, I’m curious. Can you tell me more about how to use it and what might be right for me?
