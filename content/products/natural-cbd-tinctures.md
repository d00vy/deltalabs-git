## Stop spending so much on your CBD tinctures!
One of the biggest issues with trying CBD is how expensive the tinctures are! We're here to put an end to that with our CBD tinctures - they're made with [pure CBD isolate](), slightly sweetened for taste, and reasonably priced to increase your access to the products you need.

##### Choose between 3 convenient dosages of **1200mg**, **2400mg**, or **3600mg** in 7 flavors!
* **1200mg** tincture for only **$30**
* **2400mg** tincture for **$50**
* **3600mg** tincture for **$65**

##### 
One of the main issues we hear is how difficult it is to figure out what dose of CBD to take. Stop worrying about how much CBD you're really getting in your tinctures and let us do the hard work for you. Every tincture comes with the dose per dropper written on the bottle, making measurements extremely easy with the use of the included graduated dropper.
