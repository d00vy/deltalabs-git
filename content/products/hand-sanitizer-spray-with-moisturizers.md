## Not a replacement for washing your hands!
We all hate living through a pandemic like COVID-19, especially when there are shortages of products you need to keep yourself and your family safe. When we had trouble finding hand sanitizer that didn't stink, didn't turn our hands into sandpaper, and didn't contain [methanol]() or  or [some other dangerous ingredient]() we just decided to make our own.

##### Choose between 2 convenient sizes of **50mL** or **100mL** with 3 different scents!
* **1.7oz/50mL** Travel-sized spray bottle for **$3**
* **3.4oz/100mL** Full-sized spray bottle for **$5**

##### It'll keep your hands soft
Using a lot of hand sanitizer can wreck your skin. We've blended coconut-derived MCT oil into our hand sanitizer to provide some nourishing moisture back to your hands without leaving a sticky or greasy feeling.

##### Need something a little different?
 We're happy to mix up custom orders for you! If you need something specific or want to purchase larger sizes at a discount just reach out to us and we'll get it done for you!
