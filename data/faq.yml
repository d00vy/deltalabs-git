  - title : Do I need a Medical Card to buy any of Delta Labs products?
    content : No, you do not need a Medical Card to buy any of our products, as Delta Labs does not manufacture, sell, or distribute any products that are in violation of the United States Controlled Substances Act.

  - title : Are your products really legal?
    content : Yes! <br> All of Delta Labs products are legal under the [Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018](https://www.agriculture.senate.gov/2018-farm-bill). All of our products are derived from industrial hemp and contain less than 0.3% THC on a dry weight basis - verified by independent laboratory analysis - and therefore is not subject to the same prohibitory federal and state laws concerning marijuana (cannabis with higher than 0.3% THC).

  - title : Will your products cause me to fail a drug test?
    content : Drug tests either test for THC or a metabolite of THC, and while all of Delta Labs products are lab tested to contain less than 0.3% THC, we advise our customers to consume our products at their own risk if expecting a THC drug test in the near future. While the maximum concentration of 0.3% THC will not typically cause a failed drug test, there have been anecdotal reports of full spectrum hemp extracts causing one.
